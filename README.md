# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project served to conduct more practices in Excel learned throughout the module. Mainly focused on the features in Excel in general also some specific functions applied and data used to generate a data visualization by following step-by-step tasks.
This project consisted of three parts; The first part was about creating a Pivot Table and applying filters using the data given in general, the second part was using some specific functions such as COUNTIFS function and calculating the percentage using simple mathematics, and finally, putting the project application into written text as a small report.The tables and graphs created during the project were also saved and decided upon.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a data visualization that shows Loise, who has achieved the fundraising goal in this project, how different campaigns perform according to their launch dates and funding targets. In order to provide this data, different Pivot Tables and graphs were created by using the Excel file that was worked on throughout the module.
This document is also gives information of the created graphs and outcomes by using the graphics and tables implemented during the project.
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis and challenges explain the graphs created in this project and go over the trends. It also explains the steps followed during the project. 
In this project, work was done on behalf of the theater for Loise, and the created graphics were added and explained.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date, monthly campaigns for theater were analyzed and trends were recorded with a graph.

As can be seen from the chart, successful campaigns were carried out in May and a decrease is observed towards the end of the year. On the other hand, it reached the highest point in unsuccessful campaigns in May. Based on this graphic, it is seen that it is more appropriate to carry out the campaign in May.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals displays the percentiles of campaigns that have successfully reached, failed to reach, or canceled the determined goals.

As can be seen in this chart, successful and unsuccessful campaigns are inversely related to each other. The campaigns were unsuccessful in projects with high targets, and the percentage of success was higher for low targets. It can be seen that the campaign, which will be made based on this graphic, by determining the low target amount will bring more success.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
In this module challenge, the implementation of some functions and the extraction of the right product were among the things that challenged me. I often had the opportunity to learn by doing and applying research on the internet. It was a bit boring at first, but then when I started to understand the logic, I started to enjoy it and when the homework was finished, I went through what I did again and checked it.
## Results
Based on both graphs created as a result, it is seen that there are high goals and the campaigns launched in the winter season have failed to reach their goals. It can be predicted that a campaign with low goals, made in May, will be more successful.

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Looking at Outcomes based on Launch Date, it is seen that the success and failure numbers of the campaigns made in December are almost the same, and they are very close to the lowest level of the year. On the other hand, when we look at the month of May, it is seen that the number of both successful and unsuccessful campaigns peaked.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
In the observation made based on the graph, it is seen that high targets are a disadvantage for the success of the campaigns. For this reason, it is seen that it is beneficial to keep the goals of the campaigns below $1000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The biggest limitation in this data is that it only looks at the campaigns of the analyzed programs in some countries. For example, only the campaign made in England for Cornermen is included, and the campaigns of this game in other countries are not mentioned. Comparing the campaigns made in different countries for each game can reveal clearer results.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
This project is based on producing charts that compare their successful campaigns for the theater month by month and their goals with percentage success. By working on a table that combines both graphs represented here in a single graph, the percentages of reaching the targets of the campaigns on a monthly basis can be obtained, and a clearer and more comprehensive graph or table can be obtained.
